# OpenBazaar + Zeronet

We are actively working to add OpenBazaar in [Zeronet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet).

## Reclaiming Darkmarket Project

[Darkmarket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHVqH8XO1Pk#t=86)

The original project had a vision of a community-based uncensored free market. 

The Openbazaar team forked the original project and after getting [funding](https://blog.openbazaar.org/openbazaar-is-entering-a-new-phase-with-funding/) they seemed to miss the point altogether. 

Openbazaar does not share the same vision and after mainnet version was released, the only thing shared is disappointment among the bitcoin and opensource [communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/4f18b5/openbizarre_developer_gets_very_sad_locks_grammar/). 

It is strikingly [clear] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXszuDQwGHw) that privacy and anonymization its not projects priority and the whole project was build in a protocol (rudp) that does not support tor or any other anonymization utilities. 

In fact, the guy in the video has no clue AT ALL what he is talking about. Such is brainwashing done by few million $$ in venture capital.

A freemarket cannot possibly exist in neoliberal capitalism and BIG-BROTHER-like espionage-state with visible IPs, trackable indentities/activities easily associated with personal info and all sorts of meta-data, related or not.

This project ZEROBAZAAR aims to reclaim a community-based project driven by community needs rather than venture-capitalists.

###Zeronet vs.   /  Openbazaar

*  Network stable / Not stable yet 
*  Offers anonymity via tor hidden services / IP is fully exposed to NSA and everyone
*  Seeding shop/pages (no single point of failure) / close app, store goes offline (ipfs is still in pre-alpha)
*  Running offline (for browsing) / useable only with internet online 

Donation is poss.

well, in the Snowden era, everyone obviously needs both of those.
