# OpenBazaar over Zeronet

project fork goal: run OpenBazaar over [Zeronet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) rather than immature IPFS.

## Reclaiming Darkmarket Project

The original project had a vision of a community-based uncensored free market. 

But then the Openbazaar team forked the original project and after getting [funding](https://blog.openbazaar.org/openbazaar-is-entering-a-new-phase-with-funding/) they seemed very much to miss the original point altogether. 

ZERObazaar does not hold that mutated vision. After the OB main version was released, the only thing shared among the bitcoin and opensource [communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/4f18b5/openbizarre_developer_gets_very_sad_locks_grammar/) was disappointment. 

It is strikingly [clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXszuDQwGHw) that privacy and anonymization is not a priority at all. The whole project was build in a protocol (rUDP) that does not support tor or any other anonymization. 

In fact, the guy in the video has no clue AT ALL what he is talking about. Such is brainwashing achieved by few million $$ in venture capital.

A freemarket cannot possibly exist in neoliberal capitalism and BIG-BROTHER-like espionage-state with visible IPs, trackable indentities/activities easily associated with personal info and all sorts of meta-data, related or not.

This project ZEROBAZAAR reclaims a truely community-based project driven by community needs rather than venture-capitalists' needs.

###Zeronet vs.   /  Openbazaar

*  Network stable / Not stable yet 
*  Offers anonymity via tor hidden services / IP is fully exposed to NSA and everyone
*  Seeding shop/pages (no single point of failure) / close app, store goes offline (ipfs is still in pre-alpha)
*  Running offline (for browsing) / useable only with internet online

well, in the Snowden era, everyone obviously needs both of those.
